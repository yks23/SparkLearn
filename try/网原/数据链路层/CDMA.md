# Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

■ unique "code" assigned to each user;i.e.,code set partitioning

*  all users share same frequency, but each user has own "chipping" sequence (i.e., code) to encode data
*  allows multiple users to "coexist" and transmit simultaneously with minimal interference (if codes are "orthogonal")

■ **encoding:** inner product:(original data)X (chipping sequence)

■ **decoding:** summed inner-product:(encoded data)X(chipping sequence)
